# Week 1 Notes – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## 📄 HTML
- Learned about basic tags: `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, `<p>`, `<h1>` to `<h6>`.
- Built a simple web page with structure and paragraphs.

## 🎨 CSS
- Used inline and internal CSS to style elements.
- Explored basic properties: `color`, `font-size`, `margin`, `padding`, `background`.

## ⚙️ JavaScript
- Not yet covered in this week — coming soon.

## 💡 Reflection
This week helped me understand how HTML acts as the structure and CSS handles styling. Excited to add interactivity next!
